The Third West Coast Computer Faire was held on November 3-5, 1978, at the Los Angeles Convention Center. This is the recording of the session titled "High level languages for micros," and the following papers were presented: "VideoBrain and the APL/S language: First pass at everyman's computer," presented by Ted Haynes. "An introduction to APL/S: A modern computational language for personal computing," presented by Robert G. Brown.

 “The existence of APL/S has been speculated for years.  More than one person has claimed to own the cartridge back in the day and it was mentioned in several advertisements, but no actual APL/S cartridge has ever been found.  However in 2021 the first evidence of APL/S's existence turned up in the form of a manual in an eBay auction.  Unfortunately the cartridge and box were nowhere to be seen.  This all changed in 2023 when a complete copy of APL/S was finally located.
Only 91 APL/S cartridges were ever made making it the rarest non-prototype VB cartridge.  APL/S was manufactured from 1-24-79 to 3-20-79, also making it the last VB cartridge to be made.”
